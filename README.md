Most of the UI for the main/home page has been developed. 

UI componentes on main page include:
- Header with a a search bar at the top of the page. This will eventually be used for navigation to other pages also.
- Sidebar on left side of the page that will display information for businesses
- The map that users will be able to interact with located on the right side of the page.
